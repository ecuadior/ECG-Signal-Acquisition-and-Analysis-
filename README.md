# ECG-Signal-Acquisition-and-Analysis-
Research Project on ECG Signal 

This research project started in November and ended in January. During this project, I gained an understanding of the key features of ECG Waveform and the ability to capture and process these features. Dr. Artan from NYIT inspired me and helped me create this research report. To learn more about the ECG my report would be posted and any comments to improve my report would be appreciated.
